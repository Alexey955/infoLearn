    <h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>
    <p class = "introTextIndent">Welcome to the InfoLearn app. It is not a secret for anyone that “repetition is the mother of learning”
        and in this application this particular technique is used to memorize information.<br><span class = "introTextIndent">German psychologist
        Herman Ebbingaus has determined the optimal intervals for repeating information for effective memorization.
            This application is designed to facilitate the organization of periodic repetition.</span></p>

    <h4 class = "introTextIndent">Instruction for use:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After studying or the first repetition, you must repeat this information after 30 - 60 minutes,
            then use the "add" button and enter the number block of information, the number of theses and
            the number of theses repeated with errors.</li>
        <li>To check the list of blocks that need to be repeated today, use the "lost for repeating" key. After repeating,
            press the "repeat" and select the block number and the number of theses repeated with errors.</li>
        <li>To delete a block of information, use the "delete" key and specify the block number.</li>
        <li>To edit the block, use the "edit element" key and fill in the form fields.</li>
        <li>To get a summary of the learning process, use the "status" button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class = "introTextIndent">I hope with the help of this application you can improve the quality of memorization of the studied material,
        and I also wish you not to forget that “you can’t easily catch and the fish from the pond ":)</p>
    <p class = "introTextIndent">P.S. Thanks to Alexander Terekhov for help in learning programming and for being a very good friend.</p>
